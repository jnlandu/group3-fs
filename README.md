## Bootcamp 2: Selection techniques and Implementaion of Resnet and Mixup

In this repository, you will find two of our projects on both feature selections techniques and the pytorch implementation of Residual Neural Network-18 and mixup.

There are two main folder, as you might have noticed:
- feature_selection: where you will find  the implementation and  our report on feature selection methods in machine learning.
- ResNet18-from-scratch ..: here the codes and the report are provided.
